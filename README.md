## Notes

<details>
<summary><strong>Audio Issue</strong></summary><br/>
Correct audio <code>layout-id</code> is crucially important for your audio device to work properly, so spent sometime to figure it out. Check the AppleALC <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs">supported codec</a> page which covers wide range of audio devices.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>USB Mapping</strong></summary><br/>
The EFI already includes USB mapped kext file of my laptop. This may or may not work for you. So, use the <a href="https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool">USB Tool Box</a> and generate your own USB mapped kext file in case if mine does not work. Even if you can complete the installation process successfully, please check if you can use other ports or not.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Use ProperTree</strong></summary><br/>
If you are making any modifications to the provied EFI, use <a href="https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree">ProperTree</a> and take a clean snapshot using this tool to avoid unwanted issues.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>WiFi & Bluetooth</strong></summary><br/>
I have included the <code>itlwm.kext</code> on this EFI which can be used with <code>HeliPort</code> app. However, if you choose to follow the root patching path, please disable this kext and add the necessary files. Intel based Bluetooth modules should work out of the box. If you decide to use non-Intel based WiFi & Bluetooth module, please disbale them as well.
